In *“On Intellectual Craftmanship”*, C. wright Mills contends the work of any
self-respecting social scientist demands they keep a file or journal, detailing
things of interest, both professionally and personally.

This is my such attempt, in which I hope to both keep my hand in writing and practice
reflective thought, per Mills' suggestion.


I have a bachelor's degree in social education from [UCN][ucn] from 2012, and have been working since graduation at [Skovbo, Sødisbakke][skovbo].

In the fall of 2018 I've started a master's degree in the sociology of education at Aarhus University. My *current* fields of interest lie in the intersection of a society and individual, as pertains to adults with cognitive disabilities and the professionals and institutions that support (or hinder, as the case may be) them.
