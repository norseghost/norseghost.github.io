## Training
I train quite a bit, with strength training taking slight precedence (S/B/D/P 1x140kg, 3x2x100kg, 3x3x180kg, 1x75kg).
Since may of 2018 I've taken up Tae Kwon Do again, with hopes of graduating to 1st Dan september 2019. 

I round out my training with the occasional run or kettlebell workout.

## Boardgames

My/the family boardgame collection is larger than most.
