# Interests

## Training
I train quite a bit, with strength training taking slight precedence (S/B/D/P 1x140kg, 3x2x100kg, 3x3x180kg, 1x75kg).
Since may of 2018 I've taken up Tae Kwon Do again, with hopes of graduating to 1st Dan september 2019. 

I round out my training with the occasional run or kettlebell workout.

## Boardgames

My/the family boardgame collection is larger than most. Fans of [TableTop][tt] will recognize many of the games.
Personal favorites include *Agricola* and *Nord Kapp*. I love the idea behind *Once Upon a Time*, but haven't had it 
hit the table in forever. The kids greatly enjoy *Smash Up!*, *King of Tokyo* and 
*Munchkin*. The cute art and easy gameplay of *Sushi Go!* is also a hit.

I also have a modest collection of collaborative games, where all players are set against the game (designers).
The white whale is currently *Forbidden Desert*. We have yet to escape the desert in our steampunk ship
before losing a team-member to dehydration.

## Stories

I spent many hours growing up lost in the worlds of Tolkien, Pratchett and Lewis. My level of books consumed has
fallen since, but I still greatly enjoy a riveting tale, as well as in-depth discussions of the stories told -
be they movies, TV shows or books. The current golden age of long form television is a source of great joy for me.
