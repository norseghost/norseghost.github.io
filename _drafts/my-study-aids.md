# Calendar and planner

![/assets/images/gear-fall-2018/planner.jpg]
I'm currently using a [Calepino Portfolio][planner-cover] with
[Calepino Agenda Perpétuel][planner-insert] inserts. The portfolio fits up
to 4 9x14 cm pocket notebooks. I've added vinyl pockets to the inside covers,
as well as a [Leuchtturm1917 pen loop][penloop] for my [Caran d'Áche 849 fixpencil][fixpencil]

I only use one calendar insert at a time. Currently, I'm only using one other
notebook in the cover, a [Calepino dot-grid pocket notebook][scratchpad], which was once 
a kinda-sorta bulletjournal, and now is mostly a scratchpad.

Last year, I used a [Moleskine weekly planner][moleskine-weekly]. I've come to miss
the task list to the side, and am currently making do with monthly stick-ins
for running tasks, as well as a smaller note for what to read when.

While I miss the weekly task list - a lot, I really like the Calepino weekly format,
where weekends get a full-size area per day. I'm quite often busy on weekends, and
having these two days be half-size is not useful to me.

# Note-taking (analog)

![image of paraphernalia on top of notebook]
For paper notes I use [.38 Energel Euro pens] with an [A4 Atoma binder]. I really like
the Energel pens, and the fine line form the Euro seals the deal. The very fine tip
does mean you need to hold the pen at a somewhat specific angle to the paper, but 
I can accept that.

When actively reading a paper book, I use a [.5mm GraphGear 1000 pencil][gg1000]
and a [Kokuyo Beetle Tri-Tip higlighter][tritip]. The GraphGear is a very nice and hefty
pencil, and the highlighter has three different tips to choose from.

# Note-taking (digital)

Electronic texts, lecture handouts and suchlike I use my iPad. I've got the latest non-pro edition,
which supports the Apple Pencil. I'm able to highlight and annotate PDFs in [PDF Expert][pdfexpert],
and take freehand lecture notes in [Notability][notability]. I'm intrigued by [LiquidText][liquidtext]
for reading PDFs, and probably should just give up and buy te pro upgrade.

# Computer
I've yet to actively use my laptop while in school, in fact. But the time of the essay shall soon come,
and ive got just the tool for the job: my Lenovo X1 Carbon, 6th gen. This is arguably serious overkill
for the task at hand (particularly specced up as much as mine is), but I should be perfectly happy with
this laptop for my two years of grad school and well beyond. Key features:
- Excellent 1440p screen, which is basically retina at 14"
- Screaming fast 1TB SSD
- only 1.14 kg (very important)
- USB-C powered, which means I can use a powerbank with USB-C Power Delivery to top off. No more hunting for
  outlets!

Apps in common use are:

- Foxit PhantomPDF, to wrangle less-than stellar book scans from lecturers
- Visual Studio Code, where I write this blog
- Very certainly the Office 365 suite soon, more specifically Word (for papers) and Excel (for stats excercises)
