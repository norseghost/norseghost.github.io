I've been interested in clothes for a good while. While this feels rather 
self-centered to say in public, clothing is a fascinating intersection
of self-expression and necessity.

Clothes are neccessary to cover our shame as well as to provide protection
from the elements. Thus, no-one can escape wearing clothes. However, 
clothes are also a canvas for personal and/or social expression.

Clothing can signal mebership of subcultures - the tribes of modern adolesence.
Lolita goth? Knee high socks, ruffled skirt, tight top. Punk? Ripped jeans, black DMs,
piercings and/or a mohawk. Metalhead? Battlejacket, black converse, jeans. Hippie?
Upcycled and homemade errythang, loose garments, long hair, shaving and underwear optional.

This becomes useful shorthand when navigating the fraught social landscapes of the 
teenage years. If you see someone dressing similarly to yourself, there is a more than
decent chance that you will have overlapping interests.

Clothing is also used as signifiers of social belonging and/or class. The mechanic is likely
to dress differently from the salesperson, who similarly is likely to dress apart from 
the manager, the lawyer, the doctor, etc.

There is a whole other post to be written about the flattening of signifiers of social structure
in modern times. The banker is as likely as the CEO as the social worker to wear jeans and a sweater
- superficially, they are wearing the same items. The differences appear in the details.

> Miranda Priestly: "This...Stuff"? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select , I don't know that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you are trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue, its not turquoise. It's not lapis. Its actually cerulean. And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then i think it was Yves Saint Laurent - wasn't it who showed cerulean military jackets?And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and its sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff.
