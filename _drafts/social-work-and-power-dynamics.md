They are very often lacking in verbal communication and comprehension, one of the
more explicit means of social communication. They also quite often possess a 
disinterest in or an inability to assign import to social constructs that the
caregivers surrounding them align themselves by - modes of dress, notions of proper
conduct and politeness. Nonetheless, they exist within a greater world, the
influence of which on their life is, if not larger, more explicit than for other
demographics.

They very often have no or little say in where to live, who to surround themselves
with, which clothes to wear, when or which foodstuffs to eat. This comes as a
consequence of not being equipped to manage their own lives (indeed, the prospect and 
notion of agency is a recurring dilemma, both practically and ethically, but that will
be a post for another time).[^agency]
