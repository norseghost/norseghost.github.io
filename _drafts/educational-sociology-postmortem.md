After not making my initial hand-in deadline, I met the deadline for my second attempt, and handed my thesis in early October.
The assessment is now complete, and I am in possession of a Master's degree in educational sociology.

Finally.

# The postgraduate experience

I was both a typical and atypical postgraduate student.

Typical, for my academic track at least, in that I have extensive work experience related to my bachelor's degree in social education.
I started my Master's 6 years after finishing my Bachelor's, which meant I was somewhat older than many straight academic track students.
This hands-on experience certainly tempered the approach I took to my studies; with a utilitarian and pragmatic angle to both studying and research[^q], which also is typical for students with my background and academic track.

Part of this pragmatic — some might even say selective — approach to studying in particular, lies within how I was an atypical graduate student.
That prior work experience?

I didn't quit my job.

This was also entirely for practical reasons.
I was qualified for an educational stipend, but that would barely cover rent; let alone feeding my family.
However, as explained in my first post, my job was part of the impetus for going back to school.
A year prior to enrolling I'd transitioned to working nights.
Within half a year of that I felt decidedly professionally understimulated.
The people in my care didn't stir much at night, and, the era of peak TV notwithstanding, one can only watch so much Netflix.
So, a pragmatic approach to studying.
Work would keep me from attending lectures every other week, but I could use my fairly high amount of downtime to brush up on reading and assignments[^w].

In addition, I took Tae Kwon Do up again just prior to enrolling; and had my black belt test during my second and third semesters[^e]

All these established extracurriculars did mean my social experience at university was quite atypical.
There were not many opportunities for socializing in the student bar; or engaging in student politics, or taking more academically relevant part-time work.

Which is fine - I knew what I signed up for; and the terms for the undertaking were clear to me.
This does mean I've not had as many opportunities to network and make connections as some of my classmates.

But how did it go?

# The results

Academically, I ended up squarely in the upper median of the fat part of the bell curve.
With three Cs and two Bs, my grade averages to a C+.
Given the circumstances outlined above, this is a pretty decent showing, even if it somewhat challenges my internalized self perception as “the smart one”.

Let's look beyond grades as a singular metric, though.
In my recap of attending the NLP conference, I lamented a certain lack of academic impact.
Many of my assignments seemed more suited to check off university progress markers rather than actually further knowledge within the field of educational sociology.
This did improve as I progressed through the program, to be fair.
My final thesis in particular was a chance to stretch my academic legs, as it were.

## The master thesis

This turned out to be quite an ambitious undertaking.
“Sure, I'll crunch 700 000 plus parliament speeches on a laptop!” very quickly turned into “Damn but I need some more compute!” — and me purchasing a used enterprise server.
Armed with 96 gigabytes of RAM; it was now practical to run some analyses and generate graphs relating to how politicians relate and discuss vocational versus academic educational tracks.
I found it quite interesting to take an essentially qualitative question and, out of practical necessity, treat it from a mostly qualitative angle.

[q]: For a more thorough discussion of this phenomenon, I recommend the article *Når studerendes uddannelsesinteresser udfordrer universitetspædagogikken* in “Studier i pædagogisk sociologi” (2016, Dorf & Jensen [ed.])
[w]: This strategy mostly held up, even though my duties and placement shifted somewhat during my two-and-a-bit years.
[e]: And passed.
