I recently found myself in a meeting at work[^work], reflecting on how the style of leadership had changed[^drama] the past year.
The emphasis had shifted from “the daily routine is all-important” to  “predictability allows for adjustments moment to moment”.
Well, all well and good  - a minor adjustment to emphasis in the day-to-day social work sausage, as it were, right?

Well, not quite.
This routine meeting led to me reassessing quite a few of my (many!) years in social work.

[work]: As I've mentioned before, I work at an assisted living facility for adults with autism and related disorders.
[drama]: In no small part due to rather... sudden restructuring of the managers at work. A long, possibly interesting, story, that.
