I recently found myself in a meeting at work[^1], reflecting on how the style of leadership had changed[^2] the past year.
The emphasis had shifted from “the daily routine is all important” to  “predictability allows for adjustments moment to moment”.
Well, all well and good  - a minor adjustment to emphasis in the day to day social work sausage, as it were, right?

[^1]: As I've mentioned before, I work at an assisted living facility for  adults with autism and related disorders.

[^2]: In no small part due to rather... sudden restructuring of the managers at work. A long, possibly interesting, story, that, should anyone wish to dig out the buried skeletons.

Well, not quite.
This quite ordinary meeting led to me reassessing quite a few of my (many!) years in social work.

----------

Working at an assisted living facility entails managing all aspects of the residents' lives.
From ensuring they are adequately clothed and fed, through administering appropriate medication; to facilitating a range of positive and meaningful experiences.
The residents where I work have quite profound cognitive challenges; with difficulties in understanding the world around them, the consequences of their actions, and in planning activities and carrying out these plans.

All of this compounds to a rather stark imbalance in the relationship between the caregiver and the cared for. 
Any and all (immediate[^3]) agency the residents have will be negotiated through the judgment of the caregivers and their assessment of the capabilities of the resident.
This assessment will (or should) be based on a collective understanding of the resident, their character traits etc., as well as an unavoidable immediacy I find innate to people work.
Thus, there will (or should) be a general agreement among caregivers as to the extent any resident can honor a given demand — which can be as mundane as deciding between oatmeal and cornflakes for breakfast.

[^3]: This is a demographic with very little true agency, caught up in a system that is heavily bureaucratised and impersonal.

# Good intentions gone bad

Problems arise when these assessments are needlessly (and illegally, at least in Denmark) pessimistic as to the residents (lack of) capabilities.
Thus, with the best of intentions, the agency (such as it is) of the resident is needlessly hampered.

The following two examples from my experience are quite clear: 

> Oh, they start playing with toys at night instead of sleeping.
> *toys are locked away at bedtime*

> They are too volatile to have free access to the common area
> *double-twist doorknobs are installed to prevent egress*

Now, readers, bear over with me, for I have sinned.
I have gone along with these transgressions.
This is not my proudest professional accomplishment.
Good intentions can be blinding.

Add to this the prior management encouraging a sense of the goals justifying the means.

Granted, there are some gray areas to be found when caring for the differently abled; particularly in the intersection of personal care and respect for agency.
The challenge and resposibility given to us who work as caregivers is to navigate these gray areas as respectfully as possible.

I have personally failed in this regard, and can only hope to do better and keep doing better.

# The power ~~entrusted to~~ *delegated from* management

The expanse and excess of the encroachment of the previous leadership upon the personal agency of the residents is, infact, too long and tedious to list.
But they were not constrained to limit the agency of the residents.
They hindered the negotiation and navigation neccssary by the grunts on the floor, thus further increasing the chances of abuses of power and undue stress upon the residents.

One of the phrases often repeated during the meeting I mentioned above was:


> We trust your judgement as front line personel

This in contrast to the previous administrator, who overruled our call to skip a planned walk for a resident.
The resident was, as we had assessed, not up for this activity at this time, and the situation escalated further later that evening.
