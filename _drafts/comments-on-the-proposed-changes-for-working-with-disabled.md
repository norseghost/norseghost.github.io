This post has been percolating for nearly half a year --- about as long as
the blog has been dormant. But now I rear my head from the depths of exam
prep and... Amuse myself with more sociological pondering.

I've [previously written][power] about the fraught and nearly
disassociative relationship concerning use of power in working with the
cognitively impaired. In Denmark, the trend has (quite deliberately) been
to actively and explicitly limit the ways in which disabled citizens can be
coerced and manipulated against their will. The intent seems to be a distancing
from the crimes of the not-so-distant past, where the 'undesirables'
were subjected to all manner of horrifying abuse (for firsthand accounts of
this, [*De forunderliges historie*][forunderlige] is an interesting read).

The Danish legislation governing, among other things, the care of citizens with
cognitive disabilities, is ‘the Law of Social Service’(Børne- og
socialministeriet, 2018)[^borne-ogsocialministerietBekendtgorelseAfLov2018].
This fall, a broad political commission proposed new legislation in this field.

The stated intent is to un-muddle the waters, as it were. Fix certain
ambiguities, ensure carers are not committing crimes by doing the
common-sensical “right thing”, et cetera. The balance is shifted slightly toward
‘care’ versus ‘independence’ — in certain contexts,

But even a cursory overview reveals that this, too, is a product of
(over)compensating for the past.
