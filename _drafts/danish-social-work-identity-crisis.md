# "The Perpetual Identity Crisis of the Danish **(Social)pædagog**"

*What does a '(social)pedagogy' even do?*
Variations on this question is asked rather often[].
By sociologists studying the phenomenon of professions, which may be expected.
But also at a somewhat perplexing rate by the representatives of the profession.

## A little bit of context
In Denmark, there are a number of educational tracks one can take if working in, for, and as the welfare state seems inoffensive enough.

Trade school

Higher education, bachelor since 2001, thus allowing access to postgraduate degrees (hi, it's me!)

conflict and tension -- a skill set/trade arguably best learned by apprenticeship paired with ready availability of reference material; not more abstract academic processes

teachers lament short apprenticeships

social educators want to *not* be paid a wage during their apprenticeships

(big fat parenthesis around the concept of 'social pedagogy' and how it is a decidedly bougie elevate-the-poor-with-proper-morals project originally)

danish convergence around one big ill fitting tent of a descriptor for three(four, five) different fields of influencing the social environment.
This, predictably, also leads to tensions, with the "socialpædagog" union calling repeatedly for more opportunities for specialization.

A group of semiprofessionals emerges in the welfare state; the *(social)pædagog* is a prime example

## What is a semiprofessio(nal)
distinction 'professional' and 'faglig', and the bastard lovechild
'fagprofessionelle'
