During the past years, I have become much more attuned to the problems of
everyday sexism. From subtle things, like my father expressing the obvious
self-evidence of his wife or stepdaughter not knowing what they ‘invited’
by displaying their feminine beauty; or my hasty correction of my son’s
assumption that his female classmates could not be expected to play computer
games well (there seems to be a certain toxic masculinity present in Hjalmar’s
class; he would rather not have a [pink lunch box] [sistema-pink] for fear of
teasing, a sentiment not shared by Storm).

I do what I can, as a part time social justice warrior, to combat these trends.
For example, while i do not limit good-natured teasing or in-game trash-talk,
certain phrases are a no go. It is not OK to call someone ‘gay’ in my house, or
‘a pussy’, or otherwise seek to denigrate someone by questioning their
masculinity (which also carries the implication that ‘feminine’ traits are of
lesser value). Nor will I abide calling someone a ‘fatass’, or otherwise seek
to diminish someone by their appearance, dress or actions.

I see the effects of internalized misogyny in my own life as well. My wife
gets asked — by other women — why she doesn't smile on her Instagram
selfies. My chosen profession — caring for others — is traditionally
a ‘womens task’, my subfield even more so. But even so, men have higher
average wages, and are, as far as I can tell, overrepresented in
management and union work. Related to the issue of wages is that it is
quite common to be denied full-time work in my subfield. Very many of my
colleagues would very much like to go from 30 hour weeks to 37, but are
denied. This has knock-on effects throughout a career. The
employer-subsidized pension scales along with wages earned, for instance,
resulting in a very [substantial loss of post-retirement
income] [pensions].

Granted, I very often enjoy the benefits of this systemic inequality. I am
white, male, and reasonably fit. This opens many doors for me. I have
never had to fear unwanted advances, been wary of walking alone in a city
at night, or fight to make my voice heard, or been subject to harassment
on social media.

But the current system also hurts men. Both Hjalmar and I tear up at the
final scene of Coco, and i have to struggle to allow myself to show that
I am moved as well. Not because I was explicitly brought up with the idea
that “boys don’t cry”; but somehow I’ve managed to internalize the open
show of emotion as anti-masculine. In one of the rare occasions where my
gender has stood in the way of my plans, I was not able to take the
paternity leave I’d planned during college. That privilege was limited to
the mother, apparently.

I state the obvious when I hope we can change. Right now I am (somewhat
cynically) pessimistic. The first step should be to acknowledge the issue;
efforts to this end have been ongoing for quite som time. But the
simultaneous rise of the political right along with toxic subcultures such
as [incels][incels] and [Red Pill][redpill] makes me shudder. Even outside
these festering sores of society, [women][katrinegisinger] who
[dare][gamergate] to [speak up][cortez] in public (often on
female-centered issues, such as heightened pressure toward outward
appearance) have to accept a certain base-level of harassment as part of the
cost.

I will continue to do what I can, in my own small way, and hope I raise a cadre
of future SJWs to carry the banner forward. I wish my sons and my daughters
have equal opportunities in life, to laugh, to cry, to love, for bodily
autonomy, and for respect of personal privacy. And I hope the societal
discourse can acknowledge the issues. A [poll performed by Politiken in 2018] [rightspoll]
does not inspire confidence, however (paywall warning). How the gender equality project today can
be seen as having gone too far is beyond me. The battle seems hardly begun
some days.

We should be better than this already.
