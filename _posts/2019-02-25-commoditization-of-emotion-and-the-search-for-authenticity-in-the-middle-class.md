As part of my course in socialization and everyday life, I’ve had Arlie
Hochschild’s *Emotion Work, Feeling Rules, and Social
Structure*[^Hochschild] assigned. As a near aside, close to the
conclusion, she notes:

> It may well be that, especially among the middle class, a corresponding
> value is now placed on "authenticity," on things as they "truly are" or
> "once were”.

The whole article resonated with me - I am a firmly middle-class
individual, with a middle-class upbringing. That upbringing, in turn,
prepared me well for my current employment, where I place my emotions on
the market --- just as my parents do.

But the above quote struck even closer to home. A lot of my conscious
consumption can be understood as a yearning for authenticity. I place
value in items with an (arguable) price premium re: function: (moderately)
expensive jeans (1900kr), shoes (1300 kr), boots (3000 kr). All of these
things have some ideal of ‘authenticity’ in common. They tell a story, a myth,
of different times. Maybe not simpler, exactly. But more ordered and
orderly, maybe? These are items for a civilized age, it seems.

My [jeans][jeans] are hand-sewn, from denim made on old looms (granted, in
a contemporary slim-tapered cut). My [boots][boots] are handmade by a [dude in his
garage][ostmo], with design inspiration from traditional norwegian boots. My
[*other* boots][solovair] have a storied British workboot heritage. I even had my Mom knit me
a sweater inspired by traditional old Norwegian fisherman’s gear.
Nevermind that I hardly know how to row, or clean a fish, even if my ancestors did.

This yearning for authenticity also extends to other areas of my life.
I enjoy cooking (certain things) from the ground up (a bearnaise sauce is
‘merely’ mayonnaise, with warm, cleared butter instead of oil), we have
a certain amount of vintage furniture (in which really, they did make some
things better ~40-50 years ago). I use a safety razor, just like old
times. I write with [fountain pens][ensso] and [lead holders][849].
I enjoy the [patina][patina] my [leather wallet][foldwallet]
achieves. My [wife][katrine] (often) knits with hand-dyed, artisanal yarns.

A cursory web search for ‘Hochschild Authenticity’ indicates, as
suspected, that she had ‘authenticity of emotion’ in mind, achieving
greater value as the middle class perform emotional labor in the
workforce. A concern for the loss of authenticity in feeling in general
seems to extend naturally from her argument regarding the commoditization of
emotion.

Not to manufacture an existential crisis for myself (and many of my peers,
if my loosely gathered anecdata is anything to go by), but this line of
thought raises a related question:

Do Millennials (hi!) artificially construct a sense of authenticity
through conspicuous consumption and other ways of (to borrow from
Goffmann) constructing a face and a role? With the world apparently gone
to hell in a handbasket (thanks, babyboomers! now we get to clean up), and
meaning and purpose hard to come by, at least the way we [construct our
identities](signalling) can refer to something ‘real’. ish. Except now
I’ve popped that bubble too.

The ~~struggle~~ disillusionment is real.

That smells of dissertation level stuff, after some amount of refinement
(operationalization of terms could be a bear to tackle), but I found it
interesting enough for a blog post at least.
