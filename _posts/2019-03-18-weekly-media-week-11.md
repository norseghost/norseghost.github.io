Not a lot of links in this list today, partly due to RSS feed cleanup,
partly due to not-as-interesting-to-me stuff crossing my radar.

## Fiction

Iâ€™m still working on **Ship of Destiny**. Not very much progress has been
made, but weâ€™re getting very close to a resolution now.

In TV land, I finished season 3 of **The Magicians**. So angsty! And
magicians truly can be shitty people too... even if they pulled
a **Supernatural** with the finale and leading into nesxt season.

**Queer Eye** has a new season out, and it is still very good. Confident
men who wish to empower everyone to be their best selves? Awesome!

Actually got some things from the library read. The initial Batman from
DCs **Earth One** setting (apparently, some sort of althistory take).
Interesting, if maybe a little bit eehh...

But the other pick-up was explicitly up my alley: Don Rosas collected
works, volume 4 (vol 1-3 were, sadly, not available). Leafing through
those stories is reading excerpts from my childhood, clichÃ© and all.

## Nonfiction

Iâ€™ve been spending rather more time than probably wise on (neo)vim
threads, procrastinating *writing* my exam papers by making my editor of
choice more better-er. Iâ€™ve still got work to do, though:

- I donâ€™t like autocomplete having no delay at all. Should set one at 
  hmmm, 1 secondds or maybe 2. Also, SuperTab trips me out when I actualy
  want to tab sometimes.
- vim-pencil does nice things for my writing environment, but having to
  tur it on and off for lists, YAML frontmatter and end-page link sections
  is annoying. That toggle needs a hotkey combo, too.
- I need to revisit my keymaps - I have a few I forget to use.

But I have found some interesting stories this week. My brother pointed me
to [a scathing disassembly of a Danish anti-cheat
system](https://vmcall.github.io/reversal/2019/03/07/exam-surveillance.html).
Le sigh. Pointless venality, placing everyone under suspicion to catch,
seemingly, 0.5 cheaters per thousand student? Grossly incompetently done?
Yup. Seems like the Danish governing mentality the past decade or so.

Fabio Rojas points to an article (from 2014, no less), [about hermeneutic
institutionalism](https://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2019/03/12/hermeneutic-institutionalism-what-is-to-be-gained/)
. The basic gist seems to be, that sociology should, or only could, seek
to uncover processes of meaning and understanding.

Archim Zeileis writes about [ditching the default rainbow color
palette](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~zeileis/news/endrainbow/) for data
vizualisations. The examples illustrate quite well how ill-suited the
ever-ubiqutous RGB full saturation approach is. Neither readability nor
accessibility are served many favors.
