# The nature of power in social work

An issue in social work that one almost cannot be too conscious of is the asymmetrical power dynamic inherent in the nature of the work. In my career working with adults with cognitive disabilities, I've seen - and perpetuated - a lack of reflexivity concerning the nature and extent of the power and control we as professionals exert upon those in our care.

This is a demographic where the professional responsibility is to constantly
make decisions and perform choices on their behalf. They very often have no or
little say in where to live, who to surround themselves with, which clothes to
wear, when or which foodstuffs to eat. This comes as a consequence of not being
equipped to manage their own lives (indeed, the prospect and notion of agency is
a recurring dilemma, both practically and ethically, but that will be a post for
another time).[^agency]They are not in possession of the required capabilities
to maintain their own existence and/or function in society - hence living in an
assisted care facility - and are utterly dependent on others to ensure their
being, at various levels of the needs hierarchy.

When a person is so completely dependent upon an other, it seems obvious that
this 'other' has a great deal of influence and control over them. This can be
(and hopefully mostly is) benign in nature, but (depending on level of
disability) is also very often all-encompassing.

This is laid out quite well by Stine Marie Hur, in which a Foucaltian
perspective is employed, and the social worker is empowered to be a productive
force in the life of the disadvantaged (Hur 2015)[^hurFrigorelsensMagt2015].

To quote uncle Ben: "with great power comes great responsibility". While a tired
adage, it is nonetheless true. A lack of awareness of the systematic and
inherent power asymmetry in social work can lead to worker uncertainty at best,
and a toxic and abusive culture at worst. The most glaring example of the latter
in Danish memory is the Strandvænget case of 2007 (Kirkebæk
2017)[^kirkebaekStrandvaengetTiAr2017].

Taken far enough, this lack of professional reflexivity turns into management
saying outright "We do not exercise power here"[^truestory]. Which is patently
absurd, given the level of power and control exercised every day for a social
worker to fulfill their responsibilities as caregiver. To be fair, what is
*probably* intended in the above statement is no *explicit* power, such as
physically restraining or forcefully relocating someone.

Except... that it *does* happen. Mostly it is justified, for example under
consideration for the safety of the citizen and/or his surroundings. And the
very clear incidents are (usually) reported to the authorities as proscribed by
relevant law.

## The clutches of uncertainty

The current laws in Denmark governing social work reflects a strong neoliberal
discourse. With it, a co-dependent emphasis of everyone having both the right
and responsibility to make their own decisions has robbed the social worker of
means to legitimately exercise their power [@hurFrigorelsensMagt2015]. I believe
this can lead to a dissonance between (the social worker's perception of what
constitutes) “proper care” and “law-given mandate”. For instance, last year's
kerfuffle over whether some doors and gates should be locked or not at Sølund
(Gruber 2018)[^gruberIntensDiskussionOm2018]. A locked gate to a garden is one
man's haven, and another's involuntary incarceration[^lockedgates].

This brings me to my meandering point, and question for further discussion. How
are uses of power, explicit or more manipulative, that are considered
'beneficial' and 'good care' and 'proper social pedagogy' (to force a danish
term into english) discussed? How is it framed? Is quietly blocking the “wrong”
(in my eyes) path on a walk protection, and thus care, or direct control, and
thus an abuse of power? What about a verbal instruction? Or a hand on the
shoulder, with me guiding physically?

I fear that the aforementioned (possible) lack of reflexivity regarding the
necessary and immense power differential, including the framing of 'beneficial'
interventions, leads to great professional uncertainty - what is to be reported?
How can we tell the difference? Should an intervention be reported if it is
clearly outside the mandate, but has clear benefits for the user?

This is a classic dilemma, and I can't say I have an answer to the questions
above, other than to keep the discussion alive. But an increased awareness, as
well as acceptance, of the power inherent in working with others, can only help
strengthen social work as a profession.

[^lockedgates]: This is an ongoing balancing act at my current workplace as well
[^agency]: How much *actual* say in these matters us more-or-less functioning members of society have is also a matter for another time
[^truestory]: True story. It still baffles me.
