# Fiction

Late last fall, I started retreading the *Farseer* trilogy by Robin Hobb,
this time in audiobook form. Starting in January, I continued with the
*Liveship Traders*, a follow-on story in the same universe, with a shared
character.

What truly strikes me ini Hobb’s writing is how evocative her
worldbuilding is, particularly when the civilized southlands are
contrasted to the northern barbarians of the first trilogy. The subtle
social commentary regarding the role of women in society from those same
books are hammered in more bluntly now. We are also shown very varying
perspectives on what it means to be a Man, Woman, Dragon or Liveship
trying to find out who you are, and who you are meant to be. All with very
believable characters, who show credible growth across the two first books
and into the third.

It’s been 15 or so years since I last read these, and they hold up
remarkably well.

# Nonfiction

Around January I downloaded *The Sociological Imagination* by C. Wright
Mills onto my Kindle. I’m currently stuck at around 30 %. It’s not you,
Mills, it’s me. Turns out, you cant read your Kindle if you dont bring it
with you... or take it out of your bag, or bring it up to the nightstand
instead of your phone.

I do like the book though. Mills is clearly an accomplished communicator,
and is delightfully snarky.

That phone, however, has an RSS reader. This past week, a few articles
caught my eye:

[Daniel Little](https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/) writes about
a new perspective on how humans think: [Bodily
Cognition](https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/). This is
a questioning of the prevailing neuroscientific model of the brain as the
Grand Computer, processing inputs and doling out neural responses.
Instead, it is more productive to think more holistically about inter- and
intrapersonal perception. As Little says:

> rather, my suggestion here is that the metaphysical questions about
> "constitution of cognition" and "the real nature of cognition" might be
> put aside and the empirical and systematic ways in which human cognitive
> processes are interwoven with extra-bodily artifacts and processes be
> investigated in detail.

My social worker heart agrees.

On [Faculty Focus](https://www.facultyfocus.com/), Miriam Bowers-Abbott
[provides another nail in the
coffin](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/course-design-ideas/from-summiting-blooms-to-promoting-lifelong-learning/)
in which Bloom’s Taxonomy is slowly being interred. Instead, other models
for course design are shown for consideration. Kagans model of
understanding (comprehension), transforming (inductive/deductive logic)
and generating (research skills), as well as taking inspiration from
workforce training programs to induce a lifelong love of learning.

I am fortunate to know that at least one of my lecturers agrees with this
statement.

Andrew Gelman writes on the [University of Columbia Stat
blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) about how
[Statistical-significance filtering does more harm than
good](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/02/27/statistical-significance-filtering-is-a-noise-amplifier/).
This made me turn my head — this is exactly how I am being trained, as
Gelman points out. At least now, I know about the pitfalls involved.

Mike Sosteric gives me [this week’s helping of *we are all
FUCKED*](https://theconversation.com/the-red-pill-or-the-blue-pill-endless-consumption-or-sustainable-future-110473).
Dammit.

Through a Reddit thread (which I cant resurface right now), I’ve added
some sociology-adjacent podcasts to my rotation. I’ve listened to af few
episodes of [Thinking Allowed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy05),
and the episodes on [snobbery](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002ml7)
and [the class ceiling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000281t) were
particularly apropos my current courses. The one on snobbery also
presented a classist angle to my discussion on [middle-class yearning for
authenticity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2019-02-25-commoditization-of-emotion-and-the-search-for-authenticity-in-the-middle-class
%}): It is a form of class distinction, of saying ‘I am not common!’.
Sometimes while appropriating the attire and artifacts of ‘common’ people.
