This post has been percolating for nearly half a year --- about as long as
the blog has been dormant. But now I rear my head from the depths of exam
prep and... Amuse myself with more sociological pondering.

I've [previously written][power] about the fraught and nearly
disassociative relationship concerning use of power in working with the
cognitively impaired. In Denmark, the trend has (quite deliberately) been
to actively and explicitly limit the ways in which disabled citizens can be
coerced and manipulated against their will. The intent seems to be a distancing
from the crimes of the not-so-distant past, where the 'undesirables'
were subjected to all manner of horrifying abuse.

The Danish legislation governing, among other things, the care of citizens with
cognitive disabilities, is [‘the Law of Social Service’][borne-ogsocialministerietBekendtgorelseAfLov2018].
This fall, a broad political commission proposed new [legislation][nyeregler] in
this field.

The stated intent is to un-muddle the waters, as it were. Fix certain
ambiguities, ensure carers are not committing crimes by doing the commonsense
“right thing”, et cetera. The balance is shifted slightly toward ‘care’ versus
‘independence’ — in certain contexts,

The opening paragraph emphasizes the need for the rules governing this
field to ensure, first and foremost, the rights of citizens. It goes on to
voice the tension in *also* ensuring care, dignity and safety for
a vulnerable demographic. A need to act counter to the independence of
another, if necessary for the realization of the latter goal, should be
explicitly allowed.

So far so good. There seems to be an acceptance of the fact that caring
sometimes means acting on behalf of, or curtailing the actions of another.
There is, however, some distancing still evident. This is to be a last
resort, if ‘social-educative efforts’ have proven insufficient to persuade
the citizen willingly. In other words, we only acknowledge that caregivers
are put in a position of power over another when it is made explicit; the
more subtle ways of control and manipulation are unvoiced and
under-debated (outside the professional discourse at least).

The proposal refers to an [audit performed in 2017][eftersyn] of practices
vis-a-vis the rules. This audit revealed a) the standing legislation sometimes
became a barrier to fulfilling the obligations of care; and b) this led to
professional uncertainty as to when a certain intervention would be classified
as care work and when it would be considered a breach of the principles of
independence.

This is not a mere semantic distinction. Curtailing the independence of another
requires formal reporting of the incident. The intent of this practice, as
clearly brought out through both the audit and the proposal under
discussion, is to allow for reflection over the incident. This so as to
avoid such measures being necessary in the future, as well as creating
a trail of documentation. However, my impression, from personal
experience, is that the former is under-emphasized, with the latter
perhaps being considered an invitation to blame, if not exactly an
admission of wrongdoing. This leads to (sometimes severe) underreporting.
This outcome is also reflected in the 2017 audit.

## A discussion of (some of) the proposed updates

The proposal states two key shortcomings in the current rules:

1. There must currently exist a preexisting decision at the municipal level allowing an
   intrusion upon the right of self, thus preventing legally escorting a citizen
   in from the cold in mere underwear, for example.

2. The field of welfare technologies has outpaced the legislation. GPS
   tracking chips in citizens at risk of wandering, floor sensors in case
   of falls, et cetera. As it stands, these fall under a general ban of
   surveillance of common citizens, and are considered loosened somewhat
   for this demographic.

There are 16(!) proposed amendments in total. Some reiterate the points outlined
above (all are to support care, dignity and well-being and/or prevent harm), but some warrant further discussion:

* The 3rd point seeks to allow ‘physical guidance’ of a citizen, for their sake
  or the sake of others in their environment. This is mostly an
  affirmation of general practices i believe; I certainly have had no
  compunctions placing a guiding hand on an arm or a shoulder. This is
  further supported by this *not* being considered a limitation of
  independence, and thus not requiring a formal report.

* Point 4 seeks to make explicit where on the twin axes of care versus
  neglect/self-determination versus control the professional carer should
  act. There are allowances made for physical restraint if deemed
  exceptionally necessary in situations of personal hygiene, without the
  need for permission from authorities. The caveat that such permission
  should be sought if the need for restraint is deemed to be recurring is
  couched in affirmations of practices again, a ‘mirroring of the needs in
  practice’. This despite the conservative phrasing; such permission can
  only be granted for the next 12 months, for instance.

* In points 5 and 6, the curtailing of independence is explicitly allowed, for
  instances of imminent harm or danger to the citizen, other citizens, or
  possesions and valuables. These however, *are* to be reported formally.
  Points 7, 8 and 14 discuss this professional duty further; the assisted
  living facilities have a responsibility to document plans to minimize
  , and actively utilize these reflexively in developing a workplace
  culture to that end. The municipalities and control instances likewise
  have a responsibility in following up on reports of intrusions upon the
  right to self.

  I refer to my previous paragraph in expressing a certain pessimism in regard
  to using reports of explicit force as tool for developing workplace culture.
  I do not see this reality as being impossible to realize; I am, however,
  somewhat dubious as to this being something that can be willed into existence
  politically. A cultural change as to the purpose and beneficiaries of such
  reports seems necessary first.

* Point 10 refers to a dilemma that has been [voiced in Danish press][døre] as
  well as seen in my own professional experience. Permission can be given to
  lock doors or windows in a citizens private living area, if they are
  considered prone to wandering without grasp of consequences. One door must
  remain unlocked, however. This seems to be an attempt to address the reality
  of not being able to keep perfect watch at all times.

* The term *welfare technologies* is added in points 11-12, to allow for
  electronic monitoring of certain at-risk individals. Emphasis is, again, on
  ensuring care, dignity and safety; with the overall intent of increasing
  quality-of-life and increased opportunities for expression of self.

  Perhaps alarmingly, a commission is to be formed to determine which (kinds of)
  welfare technologies are permissible. More bureaucracy never hurt anyone,
  right? Right?

* Apparently, there currently exists no need for the care facility to inform the
  citizens custodians et al. about interventions such as these. Point 16 seeks
  to remedy this, which I find hard to fault.

All in all, this proposal seeks to address specific shortcomings as to the
intersections of commonsense interventions as part of the responsibilities of
care and the right of any citizen to agency, self-determination and independence
of will. Secondarily, there is an attempt to dislodge certain ambiguities as
well as bring the legislation more in line with the realities of social care. So
far, so mostly good.

Aside from my perceived need to reframe the act of reporting infringements of
power, this document also encapsulates the semi-professional status of
professional caregivers (*social educator* is the closest translation available
from the Danish *socialpædagog*). Professional autonomy is constantly under
political impingement, which point 4 is a very explicit example of. Social care
can be described, at least partially, as navigating that 4-cell matrix of
neglect/care vs independence/abuse of power. On one hand, clear expectations and
allowances are informative and supportive; on the other, there is the risk of
losing professional justification and identity. Which probably is an idea for
another post.
