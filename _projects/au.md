A selection of the assignments and research I've conducted as I've pursued a MA in Educational Sociology.
The reports are all in Danish.

## Essay Collection in Comparative Studies in Education, Institutions and Policy

In this essay collection, I critique various aspects of disability policies in Denmark.
I touch on:

- The prevalence of *neuropedagogy* (and similar “citizen-first” approaches) in the special needs field. Are theay really as empirically valid as is posited? Or is this merely professional hubris?
- The vast amount of data generated on an about itizens “in the system”. Part bureaucratic accountability, part CYA; all digitized in electronic journalling systems. But who is really being documented? The citizen? Or the professional opinion of them?
- The (at best) semi-successful attempt to redefine “special education” and the students who receive it.
- A meta-level look at the dis/ability discourse in Denmark. I use James Scheurich's policy archaeology approach to look behind and beyond the given-ness of the issues at hand, and discuss how and why these are constituted as issues.

## Exam paper in Socialization and Everyday Life

I took a look at positions concerning masculinity in the days immediately after Gillette launched the `#thebestmencanbe` ad campaign in January 2019.
I scraped Instagram for hashtags surrounding this topc, and performed naive frequency analysis in R to discern topic clusters.
Based on these clusters, I analyzed the positioning and performative aspects with a basis in Goffman's theater metaphor, as well as borrowing positioning theory from social psychology.
