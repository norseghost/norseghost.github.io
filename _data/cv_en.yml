In addition, i explored computational sociology through an analysis of Instagram posts, in which I explored R and the tidyverse.

  note: Specialized in citizens with disability, with a particular focus on the role of the practitioner. I am particularly pleased with my work on the necessity of action for the practitioner. People-work requires action - even inaction is an action. This, in turn, places great demands upon the practitioner's self-reflexivity, both as an episode unfolds as well as afterward.
